#Q.1 arithmetic operators
# addition,subtraction multiplication,divison.
#addition("+")
a=1
b=2
c=a+b
print(c)
#here addition is done.
#subtraction
a=1
b=2
c=a-b
print(c)
#in python not required any decleration of variable.
#division:
a=1
b=2
c=a*b
print(c)
#division::::
a=4
b=3
c=a/b
print(c)
#here float values directly taken.


#Q.2  increment operator
x = 20
x = x+1
print(x)
#above code shows increament operator.otherwise we can write as X+=1.here 1 number is added .the result is 21 came.
#decrement
x = 20
x = x-1
print(x)
#the above code will shows decrement the value.this operators are use in loops concept.


#Q.3. two numbers are equal or not...
a=4 #here we can use user input also by using input()
b=6
if a==b:
	print("equal")
else:
	print("not equal")
	
	
#Q4..relational operators
#less than<
a=4

if a<b:
	print("a is less than b")
else:
	print("a is greater than b")
#greater than>

	print("a is less than b")

#Q5 smaller and larger number
